ExSTraCS V2.0: Extended Supervised Tracking and Classifying System - An advanced LCS designed specifically for complex, noisy classification/data mining tasks,
such as biomedical/bioinformatics/epidemiological problem domains.  This algorithm should be well suited to any supervised learning problem involving
classification, prediction, data mining, and knowledge discovery.  This algorithm would NOT be suited to function approximation, behavioral modeling,
or other multi-step problems.  This LCS algorithm is most closely based on the "UCS" algorithm, an LCS introduced by Ester Bernado-Mansilla and
Josep Garrell-Guiu (2003) which in turn is based heavily on "XCS", an LCS introduced by Stewart Wilson (1995).
